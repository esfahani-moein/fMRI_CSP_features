# Exploring Schizophrenia Classification in fMRI Data: A Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) Approach

This repository contains the code and data associated with the research paper: "Exploring Schizophrenia Classification in fMRI Data: A Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) Approach for Enhanced Feature Extraction and Classification."

## Abstract

In the exploration of dynamic changes in network connectivity within resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), the dominant focus has traditionally been on a holistic study of the entire brain. Various methodologies and analyses have been applied in prior research within this domain. This study takes a novel approach by delving into a comparative analysis of the similarities between electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with motor imagery tasks and rs-fMRI signal. Both data types collect time series data from their respective datasets. Drawing from the insights of previous research, the common spatial patterns (CSP) method, mostly used for its efficacy in handling EEG signals, was employed. Notably, CSP is a supervised learning transformation of signals, offering advantages over the implementation of deep learning models. this study pioneers the integration of the CSP method with fMRI â€¦


## Overview

This project investigates the application of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) for feature extraction and classification of schizophrenia using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data.  The repository provides the implementation of the proposed CSP-based methodology, along with the preprocessed fMRI data used in the study.  Results presented in the paper can be reproduced using the provided code and data.
